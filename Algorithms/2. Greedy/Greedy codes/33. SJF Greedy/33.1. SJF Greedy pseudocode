1. Sort the processes by their burst time in ascending order.
2. Set the completion time of the first process to its burst time and calculate its turnaround time and waiting time.
3. For each process from 2 to n, calculate the completion time, turnaround time and waiting time as follows:
    a. Completion time = previous process completion time + current process burst time
    b. Turnaround time = completion time - arrival time
    c. Waiting time = turnaround time - burst time
4. Calculate the average waiting time and average turnaround time.

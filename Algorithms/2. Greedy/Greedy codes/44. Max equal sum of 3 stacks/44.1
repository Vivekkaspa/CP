1. Calculate the sum of elements in each stack and store it in variables sum1, sum2, and sum3 respectively.
2. Repeat the following steps while any two stacks have the same sum:
   a. Find the stack with the maximum sum among the three.
   b. Pop the top element from the stack with the maximum sum and subtract it from the corresponding sum variable.
3. Print the sum of any of the stacks (as all stacks will have the same sum at this point).

1. Initialize an array of size 26 to store the frequency of each letter of the alphabet
2. Initialize a variable to store the maximum frequency and set it to 0
3. Initialize a variable to store the count of strings with a majority character and set it to 0
4. Read in the number of strings to be checked
5. For each string:
      a. Initialize the frequency array to 0
      b. Read in the string and calculate the frequency of each letter
      c. Find the maximum frequency in the array
      d. If the maximum frequency is greater than half the length of the string, increment the count of strings with a majority character
6. Print the count of strings with a majority character

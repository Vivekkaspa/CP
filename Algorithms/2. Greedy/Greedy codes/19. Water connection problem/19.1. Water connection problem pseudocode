1. Initialize an empty result array
2. Sort all connections based on their starting point
3. For each connection in the sorted list:
    a. Check if the starting point is already in the result array
        i. If yes, skip to the next connection
        ii. If no, find the minimum endpoint of all the connections that start from the current point
    b. If there is no connection starting from the current point, skip to the next connection
    c. Add the current connection to the result array
    d. Repeat steps a-c until all connections have been processed
4. Return the result array

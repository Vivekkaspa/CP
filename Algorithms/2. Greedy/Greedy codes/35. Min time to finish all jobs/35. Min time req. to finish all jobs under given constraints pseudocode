1. Sort the jobs in decreasing order of their processing time.
2. Initialize an empty array to hold the completion times of the jobs.
3. Traverse through the jobs one by one.
4. For each job, find the smallest completion time that is greater than or equal to the job's release time.
5. If such a completion time exists, assign the job to that time slot and update the completion time array.
6. If no such completion time exists, assign the job to the next available time slot after the maximum completion time in the array and update the completion time array.
7. Repeat steps 4-6 for all jobs.
8. The minimum time required to finish all jobs is the maximum completion time in the array.

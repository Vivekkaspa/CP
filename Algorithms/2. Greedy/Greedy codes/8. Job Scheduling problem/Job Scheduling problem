Algorithm JOB_SCHEDULING( J, D, P )
// Description : Schedule the jobs using the greedy approach which maximizes the profit

// Input : 		 
J: Array of N jobs
D: Array of the deadline for each job
P: Array of profit associated with each job

// Output : Set of scheduled job which gives maximum profit

Sort all jobs in J in decreasing order of profit
S ← Φ	// S is set of scheduled jobs, initially it is empty 
SP ← 0	// Sum is the profit earned 

for i ← 1 to N do
    if Job J[i] is feasible then
        Schedule the job in the latest possible free slot meeting its deadline.
        S ← S ∪ J[i]
        SP ← SP + P[i]
    end

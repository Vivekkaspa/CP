1. Initialize an empty queue to hold the current pages in memory.
2. Traverse through the page requests one by one.
3. For each page request, check if the page is already in the queue.
4. If the page is already in the queue, move it to the front of the queue (since it is the most recently used page).
5. If the page is not in the queue, check if the queue is at its maximum capacity.
6. If the queue is at its maximum capacity, remove the least recently used page (the page at the back of the queue).
7. Add the new page to the front of the queue.
8. Repeat steps 3-7 for all page requests.

1. Sort the arrival and departure times in non-decreasing order
2. Initialize the minimum number of platforms to 0 and the current number of platforms to 0
3. Iterate through the arrival and departure times:
    a. If the current arrival time is less than or equal to the current departure time, increment the current number of platforms
    b. Otherwise, decrement the current number of platforms and move to the next departure time
    c. Update the minimum number of platforms to the maximum of its current value and the current number of platforms
4. Return the minimum number of platforms

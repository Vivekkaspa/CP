1. Read in the size of the cache and the number of memory accesses
2. Initialize a cache array of size equal to the cache size, and initialize each element to -1 to indicate an empty slot
3. Initialize a variable to store the number of cache misses and set it to 0
4. For each memory access:
      a. Check if the requested item is already in the cache
      b. If it is, continue to the next memory access
      c. If it is not, check if there is an empty slot in the cache
           i. If there is, add the requested item to the cache and continue to the next memory access
           ii. If there is not, evict the least recently used item from the cache and add the requested item to the cache
5. Print the number of cache misses

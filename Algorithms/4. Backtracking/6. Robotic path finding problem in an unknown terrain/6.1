1. Define a function that takes in the terrain map, the robot's starting position, the robot's goal position, and the current path as input
2. If the current position is the goal position, then print the path as a solution and return
3. For each adjacent position, check if it is a valid move
4. If it is a valid move, add it to the current path and recursively call the function
5. Remove the last position from the current path and continue to the next adjacent position

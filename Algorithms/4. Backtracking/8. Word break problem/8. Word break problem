1. Define a function that takes in the string, a dictionary of valid words, and the current path as input
2. If the entire string has been processed, then print the current path as a solution and return
3. For each prefix of the string, check if it is a valid word
4. If it is a valid word, add it to the current path and recursively call the function with the remaining suffix of the string
5. Remove the last word from the current path and continue to the next prefix of the string

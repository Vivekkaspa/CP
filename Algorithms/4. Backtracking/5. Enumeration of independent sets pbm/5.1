1. Define a function that takes in the graph and the current independent set as input
2. If the current independent set is empty, then print it as a solution and return
3. For each vertex in the graph, check if it is independent of the current set
4. If it is independent, add it to the current set and recursively call the function
5. Remove the vertex from the current set and continue to the next vertex

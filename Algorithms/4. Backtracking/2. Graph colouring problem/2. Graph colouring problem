1. Set up the graph G with V vertices and E edges
2. Set up an empty solution array of size V to store the color of each vertex
3. Set the color of the first vertex to 0
4. For each vertex v in the graph, try to assign a color to v that is not already used by any of its adjacent vertices
5. If no such color is found, backtrack to the previous vertex and try a different color for it
6. Repeat step 5 until a valid coloring of the graph is found

1. Set up the graph representation as a 2D array
2. Initialize the cost array with INT_MAX values for all nodes except for the final node which should be initialized with 0
3. Initialize the path array with -1 values for all nodes
4. Starting from the second last node, traverse backwards through the graph
5. For each node at a given stage:
   a. Traverse through all the outgoing edges and calculate the cost for each edge
   b. Find the minimum cost among all the outgoing edges and update the cost and path arrays for the node
6. Starting from the first node, traverse forwards through the graph
7. For each node at a given stage:
   a. Traverse through all the incoming edges and calculate the cost for each edge
   b. Find the minimum cost among all the incoming edges and update the cost and path arrays for the node
8. Print the optimal path and its cost

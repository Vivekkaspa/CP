Here, n and k are the inputs to the function representing the binomial coefficient n choose k. The function uses a memoization table memo to store the values of previously computed subproblems. If the value of memo[n][k] is already computed, the function returns that value without computing it again. Otherwise, it recursively computes the binomial coefficient using the formula C(n, k) = C(n-1, k-1) + C(n-1, k), where C(n, k) represents n choose k.

Here's an example of the memoization table for n = 5 and k = 3:


   0  1  2  3
0 -1 -1 -1 -1
1 -1  1 -1 -1
2 -1  1  1 -1
3 -1  1  2  1
4 -1  1  3  3
5 -1  1  4  6


In this table, the value -1 represents an empty entry, and the diagonal entries (where k = 0 or k = n) are initialized to 1. The function recursively fills in the table and returns the value 6, which is the binomial coefficient 5 choose 3.

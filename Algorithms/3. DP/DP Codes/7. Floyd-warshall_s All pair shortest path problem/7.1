FloydWarshall(graph G):
  Let dist be a matrix of size n x n initialized to infinity
  for each vertex v in G:
    dist[v][v] ← 0
  for each edge (u,v) in G:
    dist[u][v] ← weight(u, v)  // the weight of the edge (u,v)
  for k from 1 to n:
    for i from 1 to n:
      for j from 1 to n:
        if dist[i][j] > dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]:
          dist[i][j] ← dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]
  return dist
